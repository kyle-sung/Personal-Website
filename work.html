                    Since I started my journey in 10th grade, I got to learn quite
                    a few languages. With this, I made small games like CityBuilder (java) and
                    small websites like this. I plan to start mobile development soon with
                    Java for android and Swift for iOS. I am also very intrgued with front-end design
                    and effective ui design. I currently run an instagram account built as a
                    community of developers, serving as daily inspiration @setupfeed.

                <p>
                    My interest in mobile photography started from my first smartphone.
                    I always love to capture highlights in my life and bring out the beauty
                    of civilization and nature to the best of my abilities. I find Unsplash.com
                    as a very inspiring community for creators like myself. I am currently an active 
                    Unsplash user with 220k+ views.

                <p>
                    It was only this year since I have decided to take a shot at videography.
                    As an avid youtube consumer, I was always amazed at creators like Sam Kolder 
                    who make good looking cinmatic shots with the most creative transitions. What's
                    even more inspiring is that nowadays people are able to make movie-like videos 
                    through the lens of their smartphone. Currently I am starting out filming with
                    my Samsung s9+ with a DJI stablizer. I plan to upload on youtube in college.
