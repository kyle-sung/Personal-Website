                <p>
                    My name is Kyle and I am a 17 year old tech enthusiast.
                    I was born in Takoma Park, Maryland until I later moved
                    to Clarksburg, Maryland. From there, I moved once more
                    to my current home in Potomac, Maryland. I attend Winston
                    Churchill High School and currently going through my senior 
                    year. Some colleges I hope to attend in the near future
                    includes the University of Maryland, University of Illinois,
                    and Georgia Institute of Technology in pursuit of a computer
                    science degree. Whenever I have freetime, I love to learn 
                    web and mobile developement, play soccer, and play videogames.

                    Aside from being a senior student at Winston Churchill, I love
                    to do lots of things on the side to fuel my passions. I have
                    created this website completely from scratch using HTML
                    and CSS in order to get myself familiar with web development.
                    I also take many photos of places and things I find interesting
                    and post them up on Unsplash.com where people all over the 
                    world can download them for free for their own use. I am also
                    assisting in redesigning a client's website and creating custom
                    content for their business. I also assist in maintaining the Bugs
                    Framwork (BF) website for the NIST Samate Team. Hello

                    my future plans?
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Looking ahead from now, I plan to major in computer science and hope
                    to experience many meaningful and awesome encounters with people around
                    my interest as well. My broad goal is to become a successful software
                    engineer and in the end, start a startup tech company of my own and 
                    create innovative solutions to problems of the future. In the meantime, 
                    I want to learn as much as I can in topics I am genuinely interested in 
                    like web and mobile development, pushing out more websites and maybe an
                    actual mobile app! The future is never certain and things may not go
                    as planned but it's all part of the journey!
